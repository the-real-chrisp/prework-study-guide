        <ul>
          <li>a variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. 
            In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, 
            down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>An "if" statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code.</li>
          <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 
            0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. 
            All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
          <li>we can have more than one condition by using "else if"</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, 
            and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, 
            but not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements: the starting point for our loop, the condition, 
            and the final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
